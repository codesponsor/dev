# Code Sponsor Development Funding Program

Our mission is to help sustain open source code by connecting sponsors with open-source projects.

## How can we help you?

You put a lot of time and effort into your open source projects, and people rely on them to do their jobs. It's important that your work is sustainable, and we help you fund it.

## Quick Start

To start getting paid on your open source repositories:

1. Sign up at https://app.codesponsor.io/developers/auth/github
1. Click on 'Repositories'
1. Click on 'Available Repositories'
1. Click 'Install' next to the repositories you want to be paid on
1. Follow the instructions

## How does the sponsorship work?

Sponsors pay to place a simple, unobtrusive message. You add placeholder to your project's README. We show these simple, relevant messages other developers who view your README. You get paid. That's it.

On CodeSponsor, sponsors and sponsor messages have to meet some tough criteria:

* Sponsors must adhere to the code of [Ethical Advertising](#what-is-ethical-advertising)
* Messages offering products or services must be relevant to the developer community
* Sponsors must accept that **no user metrics will be collected or shared**

## What is Ethical Advertising?

Sometimes the sponsor message will just be a note of goodwill, and sometimes it'll be an advertisement aimed at developers. We're developers too and we don't want our projects cluttered with intrusive, irrelevant, or offensive ads. We also don't want our data tracked, shared, or sold. So we'll never do that to you, ever.

* We only show unobtrusive, relevant text-based messages
* We donâ€™t track, collect, or share identifying user data
* We give final say and control to project maintainers
* We host everything, no third-party code or images
* We share the revenue with participating projects
* We set aside 10% of all traffic to free community messages that help raise awareness for other open source projects

Ethical advertising was introduced by [readthedocs.io](http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html) in an effort to fund their platform.

## What does it look like?

Here's an example of a sponsored link:

<a href="https://app.codesponsor.io/link/Z24Ypyn8iC1Q4i6uCwNyLW3r/codesponsor/core-values"><img src="https://app.codesponsor.io/embed/Z24Ypyn8iC1Q4i6uCwNyLW3r/codesponsor/core-values.svg" alt="Sponsor" style="width: 873px; height: 67px;"/></a>

The content of the "sponsored by" link will be approved by developers and must be relevant to the developer audience.
